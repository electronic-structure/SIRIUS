Welcome to the git-based distribution of the ELPA eigensolver library.

If you are reading this file, you have obtained the ELPA library
through the git repository that hosts the source code and also allows
you to contribute improvements to the project if necessary.

In your use of ELPA, please respect the copyright restrictions
found below and in the "COPYING" directory in this repository. In a
nutshell, if you make improvements to ELPA, copyright for such
improvements remains with you, but we request that you relicense any
such improvements under the same exact terms of the (modified) LGPL v3
that we are using here. Please do not simply absorb ELPA into your own
project and then redistribute binary-only without making your exact
version of the ELPA source code (unmodified or MODIFIED) available as
well.

  overview description of the ELPA library as such, and ask you to
  make appropriate reference to that as well, once it appears.

*** Using ELPA: 

ELPA is designed to be compiled (Fortran) on its own, to be later
linked to your own application. In order to use ELPA, you must still
have a set of separate libraries that provide

  - Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS)
  - Lapack routines
  - Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subroutines (BLACS)
  - Scalapack routines
  - a working MPI library

Appropriate libraries can be obtained and compiled separately on many
architectures as free software. Alternatively, pre-packaged libraries
are usually available from any HPC proprietary compiler vendors.

For example, Intel's ifort compiler contains the "math kernel library"
(MKL), providing BLAS/Lapack/BLACS/Scalapack functionality. (except on
Mac OS X, where the BLACS and Scalapack part must still be obtained
and compiled separately). 

A very usable general-purpose MPI library is OpenMPI (ELPA was tested
with OpenMPI 1.4.3 for example). Intel MPI seems to be a very well
performing option on Intel platforms.

Examples of how to use ELPA are included in the accompanying
test_*.f90 subroutines in the "test" directory. An example makefile 
"Makefile.example" is also included as a minimal example of how to 
build and link ELPA to any other piece of code. In general, however,
we suggest to use the build environment in order to install ELPA
as library to your system. 


*** Structure of this repository:

* README file - this file. Please also consult the ELPA Wiki, and
  consider adding any useful information that you may have.

* COPYING directory - the copyright and licensing information for ELPA.

* src directory - contains all the files that are needed for the
  actual ELPA subroutines. If you are attempting to use ELPA in your
  own application, these are the files which you need. 

* test directory

- Contains the Makefile that demonstrates how to compile and link to
  the ELPA routines

- All test programs solve a eigenvalue problem and check the correctnes
  of the result by evaluating || A*x - x*lamba || and checking the
  orthogonality of the eigenvectors

  elpa1_test_real         Real eigenvalue problem, 1 stage solver
  test_real_gen     Real generalized eigenvalue problem, 1 stage solver
  elpa1test_complex      Complex eigenvalue problem, 1 stage solver
  test_complex_gen  Complex generalized eigenvalue problem, 1 stage solver
  elpa2_test_real        Real eigenvalue problem, 2 stage solver
  elpa2test_complex    Complex eigenvalue problem, 2 stage solver

- There are two programs which read matrices from a file, solve the
  eigenvalue problem, print the eigenvalues and check the correctness
  of the result (all using elpa1 only)

  read_real         for the real eigenvalue problem
  read_real_gen     for the real generalized eigenvalue problem
                    A*x - B*x*lambda = 0

  read_real has to be called with 1 command line argument (the file
  containing the matrix). The file must be in ASCII (formatted) form.

  read_real_gen has to be called with 3 command line arguments. The
  first argument is either 'asc' or 'bin' (without quotes) and
  determines the format of the following files. 'asc' refers to ASCII
  (formatted) and 'bin' to binary (unformatted). Command line
  arguments 2 and 3 are the names of the files which contain matrices
  A and B.

  The structure of the matrix files for read_real and read_real_gen
  depends on the format of the files:

  * ASCII format (both read_real and read_real_gen):

    The files must contain the following lines:

      - 1st line containing the matrix size
      - then following the upper half of the matrix in column-major
        (i.e. Fortran) order, one number per line:
        a(1,1)
        a(1,2)
        a(2,2)
        ...
        a(1,i)
        ...
        a(i,i)
        ...
        a(1,n)
        ...
        a(n,n)


  * Binary format (read_real_gen only):

    The files must contain the following records:

      - 1st record:  matrix size  (type integer)
      - 2nd record:  a(1,1)
      - 3rd record:  a(1,2)  a(2,2)
      - ...
      - ...          a(1,i)   ...   a(i,i)
      - ...
      - ...          a(1,n)      ...         a(n,n)

    The type of the matrix elements a(i,j) is real*8.
