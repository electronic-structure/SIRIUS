/// Inner product between wave-functions.
/** This function computes the inner product using a moving window scheme plus allreduce.
 *  The input wave-functions data must be previously allocated on the GPU.
 *  The result is always returned in the CPU pointer. In case of a single MPI rank the result is also returned in the
 *  GPU pointer.
 *
 *  The following \f$ m \times n \f$ sub-matrix is computed:
 *  \f[
 *    S_{irow0+i,jcol0+j} = \langle \phi_{i0 + i} | \tilde \phi_{j0 + j} \rangle
 *  \f]
 *
 *  \param [in]  mem     Type of preferred memory for the resulting matrix.
 *  \param [in]  la      Type of BLAS linear algebra driver.
 *  \param [in]  ispn    Index of spin (0, 1, or 2; 2 means the contribution from two spinor components).
 *  \param [in]  bra     "bra" wave-functions \f$ \phi \f$.
 *  \param [in]  i0      Index of the first "bra" wave-function.
 *  \param [in]  m       Number of "bra" wave-functions.
 *  \param [in]  ket     "ket" wave-functions \f$ \tilde \phi \f$.
 *  \param [in]  j0      Index of the first "ket" wave-function.
 *  \param [in]  n       Number of "ket" wave-functions.
 *  \param [out] result  Resulting inner product matrix \f$ S \f$.
 *  \param [in]  irow0   First row (in the global matrix) of the inner product sub-matrix.
 *  \param [in]  jcol0   First column (in the global matix) of the inner product sub-matrix.
