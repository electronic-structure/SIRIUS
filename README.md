## Introduction
SIRIUS is a domain specific library for electronic structure calculations. It is designed to work with codes such as Exciting, Elk and Quantum ESPRESSO. SIRIUS is written in C++11 with MPI, OpenMP and CUDA programming models.

## Installation
SIRIUS depends on the following libraries: MPI, BLAS, LAPACK, GSL, LibXC, HDF5, spglib, FFTW and optionally on ScaLAPACK, ELPA, MAGMA and CUDA. Some of the libraries (GSL, LibXC, HDF5, spglib, FFTW) can be downloaded and configured automatically by the helper Python script ``prerequisite.py``, other libraries must be provided by a system or a developer. We use CMake as a building tool. To compile and install SIRIUS (assuming that all the libraries are installed in the standard paths) run a cmake command from an empty directory followed by a make command:
```console
$ mkdir _build
$ cd _build
$ CXX=mpic++ CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local
$ make
$ make install
```
This will compile SIRIUS in a most simple way: CPU-only mode without parallel linear algebra routines.

In order to download and build the compulsory dependencies (xc, gsl, spg, fftw)
the script `prerequisite.py` can be used:

```console
$ mkdir -p libs
$ python prerequisite.py ${PWD}/libs xc spg gsl fftw hdf5
```
